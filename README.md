# Phishing-Websites-Detection
Phishing is a common attack on credulous people by
making them to disclose their unique information using counterfeit
websites. The objective of phishing website URLs is to purloin the
personal information like user name, passwords and online
banking transactions. Phishers use the websites which are visually
and semantically similar to those real websites. As technology
continues to grow, phishing techniques started to progress rapidly
and this needs to be prevented by using anti-phishing mechanisms
to detect phishing. Machine learning is a powerful tool used to
strive against phishing attacks
